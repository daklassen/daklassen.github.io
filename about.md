This is [Fabio Basile](http://fffabs.com/)'s little online notebook. I like to design apps, websites and games for people like you, and I use this space to occasionally talk about them. I am a self-taught digital designer and occasional speaker.

 I hold a combined Bachelor's Degree in software engineering and video game development from [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk) and the [University of Central Lancashire](http://www.uclan.ac.uk).

I also run [Brotherhood](http://brotherhood.io), with my business and design partner [Jamie](http://www.syke.co). I spend most of my time between the UK, Italy and Japan. I am an advocate of remote work.

AT&T Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Trying out lists:

- Item
- Item 2
- Item 3

Or Ordered lists

1. Yo
2. Is
3. Cool

Nested Lists

1. Item 1
   1. A corollary to the above item.
   2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
  * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
        * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
        * You might want to consider makign a new list.
3. Item 3

```x = 2
x = 2 + 2
